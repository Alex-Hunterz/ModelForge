The administration was forced to withdraw the decision within 24 hours of issuing the circular after it received flak from employees and was slammed on social media.,"The Daman and Diu administration on Wednesday withdrew a circular that asked women staff to tie rakhis on male colleagues after the order triggered a backlash from employees and was ripped apart on social media.The union territory?s administration was forced to retreat within 24 hours of issuing the circular that made it compulsory for its staff to celebrate Rakshabandhan at workplace.?It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7. In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival."

""Her life now is all about wearing short clothes, going to gym or salon, enjoying vacation[s],"" the user commented. Malaika responded, ""You certainly got to get your damn facts right before spewing sh*t on me...when you know nothing about me.""","From her special numbers to TV?appearances, Bollywood actor Malaika Arora Khan has managed to carve her own identity. The actor, who made her debut in the Hindi film industry with the blockbuster debut opposite Shah Rukh Khan in Chaiyya Chaiyya from Dil Se (1998), is still remembered for the song. However, for trolls, she is a woman first and what matters right now is that she divorced a ?rich man?.  On Wednesday, Malaika Arora shared a gorgeous picture of herself on Instagram and a follower decided to troll her for using her ?alumni?

Apart from being a successful woman who lives life on her own terms, Malaika has literally played all the roles traditionally prescribed for a woman - she married quite early, had a son and raised him and was always around with the ?khandan?. But then, she got divorced and alimony is the taunt being thrown at her. The details of the alimony are only known to Malaika, her husband Arbaaz Khan and perhaps the family. The couple has handled the divorce with the utmost dignity. But we can vouch for the fact that she did not  need an alimony to buy clothes (short or not, her choice), go on vacations and enjoy her life. If anything, she is as successful, if not more, than her ex-husband.What happened between Arbaaz and Malaika is their personal concern. But to claim that Malaika married and then divorced Arbaaz for money doesn?t hold water.

Earlier, Bihar Health Minister defined virgin as being an unmarried woman and did not consider the term objectionable. The institute, however, faced strong backlash for asking new recruits to declare their virginity in the form.","The Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna amended its marital declaration form on Thursday, replacing the word ?virgin? with ?unmarried? after controversy.Until now, new recruits to the super-specialty medical institute in the state capital were required to declare if they were bachelors, widowers or virgins.IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said institute director Dr NR Biswas held a meeting on Thursday morning before directing that the word ?virgin? on the marital declaration form be immediately replaced with ?unmarried?. Dr Biswas had just returned after a four-day leave of absence.Earlier, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey had ended up redefining the very meaning of virginity in his attempts to justify the awkward phrasing of the question in the form. Following a public furore over the document on Wednesday, the minister told news channels that there was nothing wrong with using the word ?virgin? because it simply meant ?kanya? or ?kunwari? ? which means an unmarried girl.Pandey had joined the cabinet just three days ago.Sources said the chief minister?s office had also taken cognizance of the issue, and asked for a copy of the form. It had even asked why the question was introduced in the first place.In its response, the management of the autonomous super-specialty health facility had clarified on Wednesday that it was in adherence to the central civil services rules followed by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.The previous version of the marital declaration form, which purportedly asked new recruits if they were virgins.

						The marital declaration form had been in existence since the inception of the institute in 1983. Some officials blamed the faux pas on poor translation on the part of individuals who drafted the document.?The word ?virgin? mentioned on the form had nothing to do with the virginity of any employee. It only sought to know the employees? marital status, so their dues could be settled on the basis of their declaration in the event of death while in service,? said Dr Mandal."

A mobile phone app called Rescue Me, which will allow staff to alert police of suspicious behaviour, will be developed. The initiative has been backed by the Maharashtra government.","Hotels in Mumbai and other Indian cities are to train their staff to spot signs of sex trafficking such as frequent requests for bed linen changes or a ""Do not disturb"" sign left on the door for days on end. The group behind the initiative is also developing a mobile phone app - Rescue Me - which hotel staff can use to alert local police and senior anti-trafficking officers if they see suspicious behavior. ""Hotels are breeding grounds for human trade,"" said Sanee Awsarmmel, chairman of the alumni group of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology. ""(We) have hospitality professionals working in hotels across the country. We are committed to this cause.""The initiative, spearheaded by the alumni group and backed by the Maharashtra state government, comes amid growing international recognition that hotels have a key role to play in fighting modern day slavery. MAHARASHTRA MAJOR DESTINATION FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is a major destination for trafficked girls who are lured from poor states and nearby countries on the promise of jobs, but then sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. With rising property prices, some traditional red light districts like those in Mumbai have started to disappear pushing the sex trade underground into private lodges and hotels, which makes it hard for police to monitor.Awsarmmel said hotels would be told about 50 signs that staff needed to watch out for.These include requests for rooms with a view of the car park which are favored by traffickers as they allow them to vet clients for signs of trouble and check out their cars to gauge how much to charge.Awsarmmel said hotel staff often noticed strange behavior such as a girl's reticence during the check-in process or her dependence on the person accompanying her to answer questions and provide her proof of identity.But in most cases, staff ignore these signs or have no idea what to do, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RESCUE ME APP The Rescue Me app - to be launched in a couple of months - will have a text feature where hotel staff can fill in details including room numbers to send an alert to police.Human trafficking is the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise worth an estimated $150 billion a year, according to the International Labor Organization, which says nearly 21 million people globally are victims of forced labor and trafficking.Last year, major hotel groups, including the Hilton and Shiva Hotels, pledged to examine their supply chains for forced labor, and train staff how to spot and report signs of trafficking.Earlier this year, Mexico City also launched an initiative to train hotel staff about trafficking.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairwoman of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission, said the initiative would have an impact beyond the state as the alumni group had contact with about a million small hotels across India.The group is also developing a training module on trafficking for hotel staff and hospitality students which could be used across the country.ALSO READFYI | Legal revenge: Child sex trafficking survivors get 'School of Justice' to fight their own battlesMumbai: Woman DJ arrested in high-profile sex racket case"

A compensation of ?10 lakh was earlier awarded to the victim. The court observed, ""It's possible despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on road."" ","In an interesting ruling, the Delhi high court reduced the compensation awarded to a motor accident victim by 45 per cent after it found negligence on the part of both the parties.Deepak Kumar, the victim, was hit by a motor vehicle driven by a government employee named Ajay Kumar in Palam.Deepak told the court that while he was on his way to work, he stopped his vehicle after crossing Palam flyover to feed a cow. While he was crossing the road, he was hit and suffered injuries. The trial court had awarded a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to him after ruling negligence on Ajay's part.Ajay challenged the trial court order based on the detailed accident report that mentioned motorcycle was not being driven dangerously or at an excessive speed, and was being driven in its lane and within the permissible speed limit.He sought examination of the contributory negligence on behalf of the injured through advocate Trideep Pais and Pranav Jain. The court observed, ""It is possible that despite the vehicle being driven in permissible limit, an accident can occur when a jaywalker suddenly appears on the road.""""Such people apart from impairing their own lives also pose a threat to the safety and security of the ongoing traffic. The fact that the victim chose to walk across a busy road near the airport, with heavy morning traffic, he knowingly exposed himself to dangers that such risk may entail. It exhibits his negligence towards his own safety,"" the court added.Quoting the detailed accident report, the court said if the vehicle was in good condition, being driven in the right lane at the right speed, the accident which was caused at a non-zebra crossing, could be attributed to the sudden appearance of the jaywalker in front of the vehicle.In the circumstances, a portion of the blame and negligence would have to be shared by the claimant. While noting that there was a fair chance of the accident being avoided if the vehicle was being driven at the permissible limit and maintaining fair distance with the vehicle moving ahead of it, the court said, "" One has also to bear in mind that not all city roads are carefully marked for pedestrian or zebra crossing.""""The time of the accident was about 9.40 am. The visibility was clear. The appellant could have well seen from some distance the movement of the pedestrian crossing the road,"" the court added."

Family members said Maan Devi left the home around 4am on Wednesday but lost her way, reaching a predominantly upper caste neighbourhood where people spotted her. ?She pleaded that she had lost her way but they took as one responsible for chopping women hair in Mutnai village and killed her,? said the victim?s daughter-in-law Kalpana Jatav.Local police first denied the death was connected to the ?ghost barber? panic. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Fatehabad, Dr Tej Veer Singh said a case was registered including charges relating to atrocities against Dalits, and teams were keeping a vigil in the area where the woman was killed.  The police also appeared to deny that the woman was beaten to death. ?The post-mortem report of Maan Devi indicates she died of cardiac arrest and not due to beating,? Singh said. Devi?s son has named two suspects, both from the upper caste Baghel community, in his complaint where he also said that his mother?s body had been thrown back in their village. Till Thursday, neither was arrested.Agra and villages in districts nearby were the latest to report the hair-cutting mystery that seems to be spreading since first being recorded in parts of the National Capital Region last week. Officials said on Friday that more ?sightings? were reported from the region, and the state?s Inspector General issued an appeal for people to remain calm.Women in at least five states have reported waking up to the sound of scissors, spotting black cats, and seeing ghosts and shadows. Some claimed they found portions of their hair chopped off, and others reported falling unconscious with fear.Police have dismissed the allegations as rumours in several of these cases, and administration officials are now issuing alerts for local law enforcement to tackle fear mongering. FROM MONKEY MAN TO UFOsParts of India, particularly rural districts where superstitious beliefs are common, have often been at the centre of mass hysteria events. In the summer of 2001, people in Delhi said they had spotted a mysterious monkey-like creature that appeared in the night and attacked people. Large colonies of the capital were gripped by fear as more and more bizarre ?sightings? were recorded. Vigilante groups patrolled the streets with sticks for weeks, before officials and psychiatric experts said the panic was created by ?figments of people?s imagination? that was made worse by the media coverage at the time.A year later, people in Eastern Uttar Pradesh reported spotting a light-emitting flying object that would attack them at night and scratch their face. Many referred to it as the ?muhnochwa?, a Bhojpuri amalgam that loosely translates to ?face snatcher?. At the height of the panic, people went off streets after sundown. Scientists from IIT Kanpur were roped in to investigate the event, and the ruled out the existence of the creature. The closest explanation, they said, could have been sightings of ball lightening, a rare meteorological phenomenon. Years earlier, in 1995, a more innocuous mass delusion took place when people across the country reported seeing idols of the Hindu god Ganesha drinking milk. "

Harshit had completed Class 12 from Government Model Senior Secondary School (GMSSS), Sector 33, this year. It was on Saturday that the UT administration released a press note about Harshit?s achievement. The release claimed that the internet giant would pay him Rs 12 lakh per month as salary after a year?s training. During training, it was claimed he will get a stipend of Rs 4 lakh per month.However, on Tuesday, Google denied having offered paid training and job to Harshit. Bharti said Harshit hasn?t eaten since Tuesday and is hospitalised. ?Doctors say he is traumatised. Those who were congratulating us are now taunting us,? she said.Claiming they did not want to blame the principal or any teacher, Bharti said: ?Harshit only told her about the call.??Family evading authorities?However, Beniwal maintained that Harshit forwarded a copy of the offer letter to a teacher through WhatsApp. The principal alleged Harshit?s family had been evading the authorities and there phone number were also switched off. Meanwhile, Beniwal has submitted a report to the education department after it ordered a probe on Tuesday.It is learnt the principal has stated that she was on leave and got information about the boy getting a job offer through two teachers. She has also forwarded messages exchanged between the teachers and Harshit?s family and the offer letter. She has also appended videos of celebrations at Harshit?s ancestral place in Kurukshetra.The report will be made public on Thursday. ?I have received the report, but not seen it yet,? said Rubinderjit Singh Brar, UT director, school education."

Notably, MCG earlier offered a property tax waiver for building basements if they were used to provide free parking. However, the owners allegedly said that revenues from parking profited them more.","Only 26 malls and commercial centres on Mehrauli-Gurgaon (MG) road, Golf Course Road and Sohna Road will offer free parking in their basements, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) announced on Wednesday.The MCG had earlier said it will waive property tax on basements if the same were used to provide free parking. Soon afterwards, 45 sites offered free parking but now some of the owners have agreed to pay the property tax instead of offering free parking service. As a result, the list has been trimmed to 26. Building owners said the revenue from parking is higher than the gains from the property tax waiver.The updated list is in the public domain on the civic body?s website ? www.mcg.gov.in. As reported earlier, MCG officials had reviewed the Central government?s notification regarding evaluation of property tax for commercial spaces and that to led to the civic body announcing the clause of tax waiver in lieu of free parking space.The 26 establishments offering free parking are Suncity Business Tower, Paras Twin Towers, MGF The Palm Springs Plaza, Global Foyer, Vipul Tech Square, MPD Tower, Augusta Point, Paras Downtown Tower, Central Plaza and Centrum Plaza ? all located on the Golf Course Road. On MG Road, ABW Tower, Sewa Corporate Park, Garden City Point, DLF Corporate Park, Platina Mall and Vipul Agora Mall will offer free parking. Unitech Cyber Park Sector 39, Unitech Business Zone and Nirvana Country Yard Sector 50 and Unitech Arcadia Sector 49 will also offer free parking.Omaxe City Centre, Omaxe Mall, Raheja Mall, ILD Trade Centre, Omaxe Celebration Mall and the Sapphire Mall on Sohna Road are also on the list.?The MCG had the option of levying a property tax on the basements in commercial centres, but after reading the Central government guidelines, an option was given to building owners that if they did not levy a parking fee on customers, the property tax on basements will be waived. Hence, for the public?s benefit, the MCG has placed ?free parking? boards at these sites for their awareness,? MCG Commissioner V Umashankar said.If the sites mentioned on the list are found levying a parking fee, the public can report complaints on the MCG?s toll-free number ? 1800-180-1817 ? or email to support@mcg.gov.in."
Dishant Sharma,"03 Aug 2017,Thursday",Human embryos edited to stop deadly disease for the 1st time,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/aug/02/deadly-gene-mutations-removed-from-human-embryos-in-landmark-study?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Scientists, for the first time, successfully freed embryos of a piece of faulty DNA that causes a fatal heart disease to run in families. The disease, called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, causes the heart to stop suddenly and is the result of an error in a single gene. The breakthrough could lead to preventing 10,000 disorders that are passed down the generations.","Scientists have modified human embryos to remove genetic mutations that cause heart failure in otherwise healthy young people in a landmark demonstration of the controversial procedure.It is the first time that human embryos have had their genomes edited outside China, where researchers have performed a handful of small studies to see whether the approach could prevent inherited diseases from being passed on from one generation to the next.While none of the research so far has created babies from modified embryos, a move that would be illegal in many countries, the work represents a milestone in scientists? efforts to master the technique and brings the prospect of human clinical trials one step closer.The work focused on an inherited form of heart disease, but scientists believe the same approach could work for other conditions caused by single gene mutations, such as cystic fibrosis and certain kinds of breast cancer.?This embryo gene correction method, if proven safe, can potentially be used to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generations,? said Paula Amato, a fertility specialist involved in the US-Korean study at Oregon Health and Science University.The scientists used a powerful gene editing tool called Crispr-Cas9 to fix mutations in embryos made with the sperm of a man who inherited a heart condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or HCM. The disease, which leads to a thickening of the heart?s muscular wall, affects one in 500 people and is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people.Crispr, or to give it its full name, Crispr-Cas9, allows scientists to precisely target and edit pieces of the genome. Crispr is a guide molecule made of RNA, that allows a specific site of interest on the DNA double helix to be targeted. The RNA molecule is attached to Cas9, a bacterial enzyme that works as a pair of ""molecular scissors"" to cut the DNA at the exact point required. This allows scientists to cut, paste and delete single letters of genetic code. Humans have two copies of every gene, but some diseases are caused by a mutation in only one of the copies. For the study, the scientists recruited a man who carried a single mutant copy of a gene called MYBPC3 which causes HCM.When the scientists made embryos with the man?s sperm and healthy eggs from donors, they found that, as expected, about half of the embryos carried the mutant gene. If the affected embryos were implanted into women and carried to term, the resulting children would inherit the heart condition.Writing in the journal Nature, the researchers describe how gene editing dramatically reduced the number of embryos that carried the dangerous mutation. When performed early enough, at the same time as fertilisation, 42 out of 58 embryos, or 72%, were found to be free of the disease-causing mutation.The work has impressed other scientists in the field because in previous experiments, gene editing has worked only partially, mending harmful mutations in some cells, but not others. Another problem happens when the wrong genes are modified by mistake, but in the latest work the scientists found no evidence of these so-called ?off target effects??They?ve got remarkably good results, it?s a big advance.? said Richard Hynes, a geneticist at MIT who this year co-chaired a major report on human genome editing for the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS). ?This brings it closer to clinic, but there?s still a lot of work to do.?Today, people who carry certain genetic diseases can opt for IVF and have their embryos screened for harmful mutations. The procedure can only help if there is a chance that some embryos will be healthy. According to Shoukhrat Mitalipov, who led the latest research, gene editing could bolster the number of healthy embryos available for doctors to implant.More work is needed to prove that gene editing would be safe to do in people, but even if it seems safe, scientists face major regulatory hurdles before clinical trials could start. In the US, Congress has barred the Food and Drug Administration from even considering human trials with edited embryos, while in the UK it is illegal to implant genetically modified embryos in women. The procedure is controversial because genetic modifications made to an embryo affect not only the child it becomes but future generations too. ?It?s still a long road ahead,? said Mitalipov. ?It?s unclear when we?d be allowed to move on.?In the latest study, the mutation was corrected by a route that scientists have not seen before, with the cell copying healthy DNA from the mother?s egg instead of the template. One question scientists need to explore now is whether mutations carried by eggs can be corrected as easily as those carried by sperm.?If all of this holds up for different genes and is also true when the mutation is inherited from the mother, it will be a major step forward,? said Janet Rossant, senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.Asked about the potential for gene editing to produce designer babies, Rossant, a co-author of the NAS report on gene editing, said it was a distant prospect. ?We are still a long way from serious consideration of using gene editing to enhance traits in babies,? she said. ?We don?t understand the genetic basis of many of the human traits that might be targets for enhancement. Even if we did, a genetic alteration that enhanced one trait could have unexpected negative consequences on other traits, and this would be an inherited feature for the next generation.??The NAS report came out strongly against any form of gene editing designed to simply enhance human potential,? she added."

You come here on the eve of elections,? the bench said.Sibal told the court that including NOTA will encourage corruption. ?It?s a recipe for corruption.?The NOTA ? none of the above ? option allows voters to reject all candidates in fray.

The petition said use of the option would be violative of the provisions of the Representation of People?s Act, 1951 and the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.In the Rajya Sabha polls, the MLAs have to show their ballot paper to an authorised party agent before putting it in ballot box.If a voter (MLA) defies the party directive and casts the ballot for someone else or uses the NOTA option, he cannot be disqualified as a legislator.But the party is free to take disciplinary action including expulsion. The defiant voter can continue to be an MLA and his vote can also not be invalidated for defying the party direction, according to EC rules. (With agency inputs)"

""While the financial system is expected to weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth slowdown, the authorities should remain vigilant given the potential further build-up of NPAs and elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities, and ensure prudent support to the economic sectors affected by the currency exchange initiative,"" the IMF said.

It has been rated 2/5 (HT) and 3.5/5 (TOI, India Today).","Rangoon is a triangular love story set in the backdrop of World War II. Here is our Rangoon movie review.Rangoon Cast: Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali KhanRangoon Direction: Vishal BhardwajRangoon Rating:  (3.5/5)When Rusi Bilmoria (Saif Ali Khan), an ex-film star who has been just a producer since an on-set accident, finds out that his fiance, the love of his life Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut), also the top star of his company, has cheated on him with a soldier, Jamadar Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), he turns his head silently towards his woman and looks at her with eyes red with grief, shock and the rage of a thousand suns.If you thought Saif Ali Khan's best moment in the movies till date was the scene in Omkara where he, Langda Tyagi, looks and keeps looking at Ajay Devgn in disbelief when Omkara (Ajay Devgn) makes Kesu (Vivek Oberoi) his political successor; well, stop right there. Saif has outdone his Omkara moment with the aforementioned scene from Rangoon. That alone is worth the price of the ticket.That and the beautiful, almost feral chemistry between the loyal soldier of the British Indian Army, Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), and '40s queen of the Indian big screen Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut).ALSO SEE: Before Rangoon's Julia, meet the original 'Hunterwali'Rangoon is a triangular love story between Nawab, Julia and Rusi. The story begins in 1943 in India when the British Army requests Rusi Bilmoria to send his beloved, Miss Julia, to the Indo-Burma border so that she can entertain the nation's soldiers. Rusi, a nation-lover, does his duty and sends off Julia with his troupe plus Nawab Malik as Julia's personal security. When the Japanese bomb them on their way, Malik and Julia manage to escape into Burma and, well, love blooms.Vishal Bhardwaj's most expensive and, of late, his most accessible film Rangoon sails smoothly as long its hero and heroine are allowed to just be. Malik and Julia's romance is slow-cooked and the essence of every moment between the two is allowed to linger before the next moment starts. It feels like Nawab Malik and Julia are floating in their own dreamland, perfectly content with the scheme of things, and consequently, Rangoon appears to feel content with itself, devoid of any duties to formal narrative storytelling. There is no rush to fast-forward to the next plot device in this entire stretch where Malik and Julia's romance is built up.Watch Yeh Ishq Hai from Rangoon here:Therefore, in the second half, when Vishal Bhardwaj and Co. pull up their socks to tie all the loose ends and ensure that all three protagonists - Malik, Julia and Rusi - find poetic justice, regardless of how laborious that pursuit might look on screen, Rangoon slowly, slowly bends and breaks its back under the pressure of Vishal Bhardwaj's narrative ambitions.ALSO SEE: Will Rangoon prove to be another Queen for Kangana Ranaut?Rangoon is gorgeous-looking with great cinematography (Pankaj Kumar, take a bow), fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography (Farah Khan, Sudesh Adhana). Love-making in the mud has never looked (and probably, never will) this sexy in a mainstream Hindi film. All that is fine. Where Rangoon does a bloody fail is its attempt to see through its two parallel narrative strands finding a common end: one, the love story, and the other, the war-conspiracy backdrop with the British Indian Army and Subhas Chandra Bose's INA mixed up.Vishal Bhardwaj, caught with the duty to serve two movies in one (an old-school romance and a war thriller), doesn't really do a Casablanca though he does give Rangoon his best shot. Nevertheless, Rangoon comes off as probably 2017's most good-looking and well-made Indian film. Certainly, this year's most ambitious, with three great lead performances. Vishal Bhardwaj is in fine form, mostly. And yes, the National Anthem comes thrice in the film.

""I haven't seen those reality shows...it cuts both ways. There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it (reality shows) gives them an opportunity.""","Aamir Khan, whose last film Dangal told the story of two girls who grow up to become formidable wrestlers, says his upcoming movie Secret Superstar -- a musical drama -- is yet another film on the empowerment of the girl child.The film revolves around a teenager who dreams of becoming a famous singer.?Both Dangal and this film are based on the same topic... That we look differently at our daughters. And probably we aren?t able to give the same treatment to our daughters as our sons. So, Secret Superstar is another film based on empowerment of the girl child,? Aamir said here when asked about the message that Secret Superstar carries for the society.The actor was present at the trailer launch of the film on Wednesday.Aamir, a father of three, feels the Indian film industry must make more films for children.?We should make more films for children. This film (Secret Superstar is for youngsters, but isn?t restricted to an age group. This is a family film... It has a wider scope. When our kids were younger, we used to show them foreign animated films which are only for kids. And that is definitely something we should do.?We don?t make enough films for kids in India,? Aamir said.Asked about the recent controversy surrounding children?s reality shows, ignited by filmmaker Amole Gupte, and spurred on by director Shoojit Sircar, Aamir weighed in.?Honestly, I haven?t seen those reality shows. But it cuts both ways (referring to kids getting platform to show their talent and they shouldn?t be overexposed). There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it gives them an opportunity. At the same time, we shouldn?t get so aggressive about it that we really rob them of their childhood,? Aamir said.After portraying the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal, Aamir will be seen in a very unusual avatar in Secret Superstar. He says he and his wife Kiran Rao were both very apprehensive about him taking up the role he plays.?When I heard the story for the first time, I loved it a lot. But Advait (director Advait Chandan) asked me to play Shakti Kumar?s character. I told him I couldn?t see myself in that role. Kiran also didn?t want me to do this role.?So, I decided to go through the screen test process. Then while doing the screen test, I had fun and this was a very unusual character, completely opposite of me. So it proved to be a challenge for me as an actor to make the audience believe in the character.?Kiran, who has co-producer the film, also spoke about not wanting Aamir to play the role.?I told him not to do this role as (I felt) he won?t be able to do it. It?s kind of a creepy character... He is a kind of guy who you really don?t want to hang out with alone in a room. So I told him, ?Please don?t do this role as it will be very weird to do such a character after a film like Dangal?.?But when we went through the screen test, we laughed so much that we were convinced he can do this role too. But he wasn?t the original fit.?When asked about the 100% success rate of his films on the box office and his secret for it, Aamir said: ?We just make films we believe in. I am just very fortunate with the films that we have made, the writers and directors that we work with and the talented people that come to us with the films that they want to make.?Somehow it all works out well in the end. I don?t know if it?s anything else to it other than the fact that we believe in what we make and we work with people who are very talented.?Secret Superstar also features Zaira Wasim along with Meher Vij. The film will release in October.Follow @htshowbiz for more"
